NTFS Permissions
NTFS permissions are used to manage access to the files and folders that are stored in NTFS file systems.


Shared Permission
When you *share*  a folder and want to set the permissions for that folder – that’s a  share. Essentially, share permissions determine the type of access  others have to the shared folder across the network.
