-- What is a Token --

· It is an object that describes the security context of a process
· This is created upon login

· Users SID
· SID of any groups the user belongs to
· Logon SID that identifies the logon session
· List of privileges the user or group has
· Owner SID of the user who created this one
· SID of primary group, normally the first group they were apart of
· Default ACL when a user does not have one setup ahead of time
· Source of the access token, such as local system or a domain
· Type of Token, primary or impersonation 
· Optional list of Restricted Tokens


-- Types of Tokens --

Primary: The standard access token that is provided to the user upon login
Impersonation: This is done when a process needs to run as another user
Restricted: This is used when the CreateRestrictedToken api call is performed. The restricted part may be needed when a user only needs a smaller scope of access than the original primary token


-- Where are they used --

· A token is normally attached to an object called a Security Descriptor
· The Security Descriptor is passed to most functions that requires permissions to be taken into account


-- Useful to an Attacker --

YES!
Once the attacker has been able to gain admin access to the machine they can use an impersonation token to gain the rights as another user on the system
This is useful for moving laterally across a network as that user may have admin rights on more than just the machine you popped!
