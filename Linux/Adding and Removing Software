One of the most fundamental tasks in Linux - or any operating system - is adding and removing software. You’ll often need to install software that didn’t come with your distribution or remove unwanted software so it doesn’t take up hard drive space.

We examine three key methods for adding new software: apt package manager, GUI-based installation managers, and git.

The remove command doesn’t remove the configuration files, which means you can reinstall the same package in the future without reconfiguring. If you do want to remove the configuration files at the same time as the package, you can use the purge option

Updating isn’t the same as upgrading: updating simply updates the list of packages available for download from the repository, whereas upgrading will upgrade the package to the latest version in the repository.

The servers that hold the software for particular distributions of Linux are known as repositories. The repositories your system will search for software are stored in the sources.list file

You can find the sources.list file at /etc/apt/sources.list


-- Repository categories --

I don’t recommend using testing, experimental or unstable repositories in your sources.list because they can download problematic software to your system. Check also first that the repository is compatible for your system.

main	Contains supported open source software
universe	Contains community-maintained open source software
multiverse	Contains software restricted by copyright or other legal issues
restricted	Contains proprietary device drivers
backports	Contains packages from later releases


github (https://www.github.com/) is a site that allows developers to share their software with others to download, use and provide feedback.
