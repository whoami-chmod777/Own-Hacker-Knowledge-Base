AD DS is composed of both physical and logical components

-- Physical components --

· Data store: Stores the AD DS information. This is a file on each domain controller. 
· Domain Controller Server and read-only domain controller (RODC): Contains a copy of AD DS database. 
· Global catalog servers: Host the global catalog, which is a partial, read-only copy of all the domain naming contexts in the forest. A global catalog speeds up searches for objects that might be attached to other domain controllers in the forest.


-- Logical components --

· Partitions: Various partitions exist in AD DS: domain directory, configuration directory, schema directory, global catalog, application directory.
· Schema: Defines the list of attributes which all objects in the AD DS can have.
· Domains: logical, administrative boundary for users and computers
· Domain Trees: Collection of domain controllers that share a common root domain. 
· Forests: Collections of domains that share a common AD DS.
· Sites: Collections of users, groups, computers as defined by their physical locations. Useful in planning administrative tasks such as replication of the AD DS.
· OUs: Organizes the elements found at a give site or domain for the purposes of securing them more selectively.

- Domain Controllers -

A domain controller is a server with the AD DS server role installed that has specifically been promoted to a domain controller

Domain controllers:
· Host a copy of the AD DS directory store
· Provide authentication and authorization services
· Replicate updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest
· Allow administrative access to manage user accounts and network resources

Windows Server 2008 and later supports RODCs


- AD DS Data Store -

The AD DS data store contains the database files and processes that store and manage directory information for users, services, and applications

The AD DS data store:
· Consists of the Ntds.dit file 
· Is stored by default in the %SystemRoot%\NTDS folder on all domain controllers
· Is accessible only through the domain controller processes and protocols

The NTDS.DIT file is a database with usually 3 or more tables. The name and purpose of the important tables are the following:

1. datatable - used to store the objects accessible in Active Directory
2. link_table - used to provide references to objects (introduced with Server 2003)
3. sd_table - used to store the security descriptors

The database engine for NTDS.DIT is the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE or JET Blue) and is a proprietary Microsoft database engine. This engine is also used in Microsoft Exchange, however, the pagesizes are different between the two databases. It is 8192 bytes in the NTDS.DIT database and 4096 bytes in Exchange.

The AD DS database cannot be directly accessed by any applications. All access to the database is managed by the domain controller. 

64-bit hardware can provide a significant performance boost for domain controllers because of the increase in addressable memory space.


-- AD DS Logical Components  --

- AD DS Schema -

One of the easiest ways to describe the schema is to say that it is a set of rules that define what you can do in AD DS.

The AD DS Schema:
· Defines every type of object that can be stored in the directory
· Enforces rules regarding object creation and configuration

Class Object:   What object can be created in the directory --> User, Computer
Attributte Object: Information that can be attached to an object --> Display Name

ADSIEdit and the Schema Management Console are tools you can use to manage the schema.  You must register the Schema snap-in by using the regsvr32 schmmgmt.dll command before creating the custom MMC.


- Domains -

Domains are used to group and manage objects in an organization

Domains:
· An administrative boundary for applying policies to groups of objects
· A replication boundary for replicating data between domain controllers
· An authentication and authorization boundary that provides a way to limit the scope of access to resources


- Trees -

A domain tree is a hierarchy of domains in AD DS

All domains in the tree:
· Share a contiguous namespace with the parent domain
· Can have additional child domains
· By default create a two-way transitive trust with other domains


- Forests -

A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees

Forests:
· Share a common schema
· Share a common configuration partition
· Share a common global catalog to enable searching
· Enable trusts between all domains in the forest
· Share the Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins groups


- Organizational Units (OUs) -

OUs are Active Directory containers that can contain users, groups, computers, and other OUs

OUs are used to:
· Represent your organization hierarchically and logically
· Manage a collection of objects in a consistent way
· Delegate permissions to administer groups of objects
· Apply policies


- Trusts -

Trusts provide a mechanism for users to gain access to resources in another domain

Directional: The trust direction flows from trusting domain to the trusted domain --> look at the diagram
Transitive: The trust relationship is extendet beyond a two-domain trust to include other trusted domains --> look at the diagram

· All domains in a forest trust all other domains in the forest
· Trusts can extend outside the forest

The trusted domain as the domain where the accounts are, and the trusting domain as where the shared resources are.

Domains can allow access to shared resources outside of their boundaries by using a trust. You can use a one-way trust to optimize performance between domains. Mention that forest trusts allow users to access resources in any domain in the other forest, as well as logon to any domain in the forest using a same VPN. 

Realm trusts enable trusts between Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 domains and directory-service implementations on other platforms by their shared use of open standard security system Kerberos version 5 protocol.


- AD DS Objects -

User: Enables network resource access for a user
InetOrgPerson: Similar to a user account, Used for compatibility with other directory services
Contacts: Used primarly to assign email addresses to external users, does not enable network access
Groups: Used to simplify the administrator of access control
Computers: Enables authentification and auditing of computer access to resources
Printers: Used to simplify the process of locating and connecting to printers
Shared Folders: Enables users to search for shared folders based on properties
