LLMNR is a protocol that allows both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local network without requiring a DNS server or DNS configuration.

When a host’s DNS query fails (i.e., the DNS server doesn’t know the name) the host broadcasts an LLMNR request on the local network to see if any other host can answer.

LLMNR is the successor to NetBIOS. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is an older protocol that was heavily used in early versions of Windows networking. NBT-NS is a component of NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) and is responsible for name registration and resolution. Like LLMNR, NBT-NS is a fallback protocol when DNS resolution fails. It allows local name resolution within a LAN.

-- LLMNR Poisoning Mitigation --

- Main Defense – Disable LLMNR and NBT-NS -

To disable LLMNR, select “Turn OFF Multicast Name Resolution” under Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > DNS Client in the Group Policy Editor.

To disable NBT-NS, navigate to Network Connections > Network Adapter Properties > TCP/IPv4 Properties > Advanced tab > WINS tab and select “Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP”.  This only works locally.


To disable NBT-NS via GPO, we can simply write a PowerShell script (see below) and save it in Startup Scripts.

set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NetBT\Parameters\Interfaces\tcpip* -Name NetbiosOptions -Value 2

Now add the script to Startup Scripts in Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Scripts > Startup


-- Confirming Mitigation --

We can confirm that we have mitigated LLMNR by running the following command in PowerShell and receiving a ‘0’ in return.

$(Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient" -name EnableMulticast).EnableMulticast


We can confirm that we have mitigated NBT-NS by running the following command in cmd.exe and receiving a '2' in return

wmic nicconfig get caption,index,TcpipNetbiosOptions


-- Alternate Defenses --

· Require Network Access Control.
· Require strong user passwords (e.g., >14 characters in length and limit common word usage).  The more complex and longer the password, the harder it is for an attacker to crack the hash.
