AD DS is composed of both physical and logical components

-- Physical components --

· Data store: Stores the AD DS information. This is a file on each domain controller. 
· Domain Controller Server and read-only domain controller (RODC): Contains a copy of AD DS database. 
· Global catalog servers: Host the global catalog, which is a partial, read-only copy of all the domain naming contexts in the forest. A global catalog speeds up searches for objects that might be attached to other domain controllers in the forest.


-- Logical components --

· Partitions: Various partitions exist in AD DS: domain directory, configuration directory, schema directory, global catalog, application directory.
· Schema: Defines the list of attributes which all objects in the AD DS can have.
· Domains: logical, administrative boundary for users and computers
· Domain Trees: Collection of domain controllers that share a common root domain. 
· Forests: Collections of domains that share a common AD DS.
· Sites: Collections of users, groups, computers as defined by their physical locations. Useful in planning administrative tasks such as replication of the AD DS.
· OUs: Organizes the elements found at a give site or domain for the purposes of securing them more selectively.


-- Domain Controllers --

A domain controller is a server with the AD DS server role installed that has specifically been promoted to a domain controller

Domain controllers:
Host a copy of the AD DS directory store
Provide authentication and authorization services
Replicate updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest
