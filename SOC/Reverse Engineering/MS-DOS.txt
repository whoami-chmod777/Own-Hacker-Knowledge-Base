-- File Signature/Magic Bytes --

File signatures, commonly referred to as "magic bytes", are specific byte sequences at the beginning of a file that identify or verify its content type and format. These bytes often have corresponding ASCII characters, allowing for easier human readability when inspected. The identification process helps software applications quickly determine whether a file is in a format they can handle, aiding operational functionality and security measures. Knowing how to work with these magic bytes can help you quickly identify malicious or suspicious activity and choose the right tools for deeper analysis.


List of some of the most common files and their magic:

File Format                            Magic Bytes            ASCII representation
PNG image file	                  89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A             %PNG
GIF image file	                  47 49 46 38    	                    GIF8
Windows and DOS executables	      4D 5A	                              MZ
Linux ELF executables	            7F 45 4C 46	                       .ELF
MP3 audio file	                  49 44 33	                          ID3


EDIT C:\AC2023.BAK

Go back to the MS-DOS Editor window, move your cursor to the first two characters, remove XX, and replace it with AC. Once that's done, save the file by going to "File > Save".
From here, you can run the command BUMASTER.EXE C:\AC2023.BAK again. Because the magic bytes are now fixed, the program should be able to restore the backup and give you the flag.
