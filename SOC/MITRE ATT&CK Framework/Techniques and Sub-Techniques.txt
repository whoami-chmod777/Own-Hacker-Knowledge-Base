The tactics within the matrix only show what the attackers aim and do not contain detailed information about the attacker's attack method. The techniques and sub-techniques, on the other hand show the methods used by the attacker to achieve his goal and how he conducted the attack exactly. Each technique/sub-technique is included within the matrix depending on a particular tactic.

If there are gray areas next to the boxes where the names of the techniques are written in the matrix, it indicates that the technique has a sub-technique. 


-- Types of Techniques and Sub-Techniques --

· Enterprise Techniques
· Mobile Techniques
· ICS Techniques


-- Enterprise Techniques --

There are quite a number of enterprise techniques and are constantly updated over the time. The current number (10.05.2023) of enterprise techniques and sub-techniques is as follows:

Techniques: 193
Sub-techniques: 401

Enterprise Techniques and Sub-techniques: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/ 


-- Mobile Techniques --

Total number of mobile techniques is less than the enterprise techniques and they are updated over the time as well. The current number (10.05.2023) of the mobile techniques and sub-techniques is as follows:

Techniques: 66
Sub-techniques: 41

Mobile Techniques and Sub-techniques: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/mobile/ 


-- ICS Techniques --

As with the techniques of other matrices, ICS techniques are also updated over the  time. The current number (10.05.2023) of ICS techniques and sub-techniques is as follows:

Techniques: 79
Sub-techniques: 0

ICS Techniques and Sub-techniques: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/ics/ 


-- Procedure --

The procedure consists of usage examples of techniques/sub-techniques. It simply shows which tool/software was utilized during the implementation of the technique. In other words, it 
is the explanation of the practical information on the use of the technique. Procedures can also be accessed through the page where the techniques are located.
