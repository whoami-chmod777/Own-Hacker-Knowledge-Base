MITRE ATT&CK Matrix is a visualization method used to classify and see attack methods of cyber attackers. Matrices can be customized for almost any subject and turned into useful visuals. MITRE has created MITRE ATT&CK matrices to visualize the details of attacker behavior using the matrices.

3 different matrices have been created within the MITRE ATT&CK Framework according to the platform types:

· Enterprise Matrix
· Mobile Matrix
· ICS (Industrial Control Systems) Matrix


-- Enterprise Matrix --

Enterprise matrix is the first matrix created by MITRE. There are more digital systems included in this matrix and are more common than those that are included in other matrices, so there are a lot more information in this matrix than other matrices. Enterprise matrix is mainly used to understand the cyber attacks on large organizations.

There are 7 sub-matrices under the Enterprise Matrix:

· PRE
· Windows
· macOS
· Linux
· Cloud
· Network
· Containers

-- Mobile Matrix --

The mobile matrix is the one that was prepared for mobile devices and contains information about the cyber security of mobile devices. This matrix can be used to ensure the security of individual and corporate mobile devices. Comparing the Enterprise Matrix, it contains less information:

Mobile Matrix has 2 sub-matrices:

· Android
· iOS

-- ICS Matrix --

The ICS Matrix is the one that contains the information collected for the cyber security of devices in the industrial control systems. This matrix can be used to provide cyber security and analyses of an ICS.
