Today, in order to fully understand a cyber attack, it is necessary to model the steps and details of cyber attacks in a way that is suitable for certain groups. One of the important frameworks that meet this modeling need is the MITRE ATT&CK framework. 


MITRE ATT&CK that stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge is the framework of a knowledge database that was introduced by MITRE in 2013 and has been continuously developed and expanded along with the technology. It is possible to analyze cyber attacks systematically through the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Cyber attacks can be divided into certain stages and the methods used in each stage can be analyzed in depth and used in studies related to cyber security. The MITRE ATT&CK Framework is an essential resource for each and every employee in the cybersecurity industry.


Since each step of cyber attacks is covered in detail in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, SOC Analysts can clearly see the actions that should be taken for each stage of the cyber attack and that it as a reference. In this way, attack detection and mitigation techniques developed against cyber attacks can be used more effectively, cyber attacks can be mapped, an in-depth report can be written and the details of the attack can be archived for a later use. Since this framework provides a clear roadmap of cyber attacks, researches can be conducted on other possible cyber attacks that have not yet occurred yet to develop ways to detect or avoid them.
