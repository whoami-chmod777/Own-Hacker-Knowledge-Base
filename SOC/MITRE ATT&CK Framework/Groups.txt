Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Groups, are the hacker groups that may include many different people and groups that carry out cyber attacks in a targeted and systematic way, with governments support from time to time. APT groups may conduct cyber attacks with different motivations. For example, the group may have a specific mission, may be conducting their attacks for money, or may be foreign government supported and conduct their attacks to obtain their national ideals.

Within the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, information about APT groups is collected which helps identify which APT group is targeting which systems and which cyber attack techniques are being implemented. When all this information is gathered together and evaluated with the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, the attack map of the APT group can be revealed.

Groups: 135

Each APT group listed in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework has a unique Group ID, Name and Description. You can also see the information about the techniques used by the group in cyber attacks at the bottom of the page.

Under the “Techniques” column, you can see what tools, software or techniques that the APT group was leveraged for the attack.
