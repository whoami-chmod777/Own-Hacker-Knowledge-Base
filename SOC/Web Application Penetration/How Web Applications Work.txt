In order to detect an anomaly we should first understand how the technology works. Web applications communicate via the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

HTTP communication takes place between the server and the client. First, the client requests a specific resource from the server. The server receives the HTTP request and sends back an (HTTP Response) to the client after passing it through certain controls and processes. The clientâ€™s device receives the response and displays the requested resource in an appropriate format.
