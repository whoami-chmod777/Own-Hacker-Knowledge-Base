Brute forcing is a type of attack that involves attempting to guess a password or authentication token by systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. In the context of web attacks, brute forcing typically refers to the process of using automated tools to repeatedly submit login requests to a web application using different username and password combinations until a valid one is discovered.


-- Prevention Methods for Brute Forcing --

1. Implement CAPTCHA: Use CAPTCHA or other bot detection mechanisms to detect automated login attempts and prevent them from succeeding.
2. Limit the rate of login attempts: Implement a mechanism that limits the number of login attempts that can be made within a certain time period (e.g. 5 login attempts per minute). This will slow down brute force attacks, as the attacker will need to wait between attempts.
3. Use multi-factor authentication: Require users to provide additional authentication factors, such as a one-time code sent via SMS or email, in addition to their username and password.
4. Monitoring login attempts: This involves monitoring login attempts for signs of suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address, or unusual spikes in traffic or requests. This can help to detect and prevent brute force attacks before they are successful.
5. Using strong passwords and password policies: This involves requiring users to choose strong passwords that are difficult to guess, and enforcing password policies that require users to change their passwords regularly and prohibiting the use of weak or easily guessable passwords.


-- Some ways how WAFs can prevent Brute Force Attacks --

· IP blocking: WAFs can block access to the web application from IP addresses that have made excessive login attempts or have triggered other security rules. This can prevent brute force attacks by blocking the attacker's access to the application altogether.
· User behavior analysis: WAFs can analyze user behavior patterns to detect abnormal activity, such as a high rate of login attempts or unusual login times. This can help prevent brute force attacks by detecting and blocking suspicious behavior before it becomes a problem.

It's important to note that WAFs are not foolproof and can be bypassed by skilled attackers. Therefore, it's important to implement multiple layers of security controls, such as strong passwords, account lockout policies, and security awareness trainings for users, in addition to using  WAFs.


-- Detecting Brute Forcing Attacks --

· Analyzing brute force attacks can help you understand the methods used by attackers and identify vulnerabilities in your security controls. To do this, you should collect and store authentication logs from your web application, including the successful logins as well as the failed login attempts. Look for patterns of suspicious activity in the authentication logs, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a particular IP address or user account. Analyze network traffic logs to identify patterns of traffic that may be associated with brute force attacks, such as repeated login attempts from the same IP address or requests to non-existent pages or directories. 

· Deploy an intrusion detection system (IDS) or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to analyze network traffic and detect signs of brute force attacks. Look for common attack vectors used in brute force attacks, such as dictionary attacks or password spraying. Identify user accounts that are vulnerable to brute force attacks due to weak passwords or other vulnerabilities. Finally, monitor for incidents of brute force attacks and respond to them promptly by blocking malicious IP addresses, locking out user accounts, and implementing additional security controls as necessary. 

Successful login attempts would typically result in a response code of 200 or a redirect to a different page, which can be identified in the log file. However, keep in mind that some attackers may attempt to obfuscate their successful login attempts by logging in with valid credentials or using a compromised account, so it is important to perform further analysis to determine if any suspicious activity is occurring.


-- Detect Brute Force Attacks --

· Log analysis tools: There are several log analysis tools such as Logstash, ElasticSearch, and Kibana (ELK Stack) that can help you analyze nginx log files and detect brute force attacks. These tools will allow you to search for specific patterns in the log files, such as repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or user agent.

· Regular expressions: Regular expressions can be used to search for specific patterns in the log files. For example, you can use a regular expression to match a sequence of repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or user agent.

Things that you can do after the detection:

· Fail2ban: Fail2ban is a popular intrusion prevention tool that can be used to automatically block the IP addresses that are detected as engaging in brute force attacks. Fail2ban works by monitoring the nginx log files and applying predefined filters to detect and block suspicious activity.

· IP blocking: You can manually block IP addresses that are detected as engaging in brute force attacks by adding them to the nginx configuration file. For example, you can use the deny rule to block traffic from specific IP addresses


-- Example of a regular expression tto detect repeated failed login attempts --

/^(\S+) \S+ \S+ \[.*?\] "(POST|GET) \/login\.php.*?" (401|403) \d+ ".*?" ".*?"/gm

This regular expression will match any log file entry that includes a failed login attempt (401 or 403 status code) to the /login.php page
