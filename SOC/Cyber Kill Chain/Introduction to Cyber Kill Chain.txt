Cyber Kill Chain is important for the SOC analyst to have a better understanding of the stages of a cyber attack and to determine which action(s) the cyber attack starts with and which action(s) follows.
The SOC analyst can use Cyber Kill Chain to analyze where in the cyber attack the acts of the attacker noticed on the systems occur. The Cyber Kill Chain enables the organization to determine where and how severe the security flaws are.

Cyber Kill Chain is a framework created by Lockheed Martin in 2011 and used to model the attacks of attackers. Within this framework, attacker behaviors and the whole cyber attack process consists of 7 steps that follow one another.
