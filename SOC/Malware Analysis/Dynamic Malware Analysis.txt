Dynamic malware analysis method is an analysis method in which malware is run and examined in secure environments. 

In dynamic analysis, applications that can examine registry, file, network and process events are installed in the system, and their behavior is examined by running malicious software.

While doing dynamic analysis, you should carefully examine the following events.

· Network Connections
· File Events
· Process Events
· Registry Events


-- Advantages of the Dynamic Analysis Method --

· It produces much faster results than the static analysis method
· You can perform automated analysis with sandboxes
· It is an analysis method that requires less technical knowledge than static analysis, so beginners can learn easily


-- Disadvantages of the Dynamic Analysis Method --

· You cannot determine the full malware capacity, as the behavior of the malware may vary from different systems
· You cannot usually analyze advanced malware with the dynamic analysis method alone, in these cases you may need to use both dynamic and static analysis methods together


-- Which tools and software do we need --

An ideal isolated dynamic analysis environment consists of a completely separate physical device and a separate network.


# Virtualization Software

· VMware Workstation
· VMware Fusion
· Oracle Virtualbox


# Utility Softwares

· Microsoft Office
· Adobe Reader
· Browser (Chrome, Firefox etc.)
· WinRAR
· Text Editors (Notepad++, Sublime Text etc.)


# Debuggers
Debuggers are software that are generally used by programmers to test the codes and catch the errors. Debuggers help to see the instructions of a process and change the flow of the program.
Malware analysts frequently make use of debuggers to learn the working structure of the malware and disable some prevention mechanisms by making changes to the malware codes.

# Network Monitoring Tools

· Wireshark
· Fiddler
· Burp Suite


# Process Monitoring Tools

· Process Hacker
· Process Explorer (SysInternals)
· Procmon (SysInternals)


# File Activity Monitoring Tools
File activities are one of the first activities that should be followed in dynamic analysis. 
Malware can read files to collect information from the operating system, write other components of the malware to the file system, and move itself to the startup folder to ensure the persistence.
