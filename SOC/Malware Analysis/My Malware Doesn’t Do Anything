From time to time, when you run malicious software, you may see that it does not show any activity on the operating system. Let's take a look at what we should do in such a situation.


-- Wait a Little Longer --

Many sandbox products tag the file as harmless if there is no suspicious activity after a certain period of time (usually 3-5 minutes) after running the suspicious file in order to use the resources in the most optimal way. Attackers who want to take advantage of this situation, add sleep functions to the malicious software they have preduced, so that their malicious code starts to run after a certain period of time. Sandboxes label software that has no activity during this time as harmless, and so it mostly allows it to pass through security products, causing it to reach the end user.

If the software you are running is not showing any activity, there is a high probability that it is using this method as it is a very common method nowadays. For this reason, you may need to be patient for a few minutes to show activity.


-- Execute as Administrator --

Most malware has the ability to terminate itself without exhibiting any malicious activity when not run at high privileges. For this reason, you can try to run a non-active malware with an authorized user.


-- Change Language Settings --

Since the number of targeted attacks is increasing day by day, you may find that malicious software does not work outside of these targets.

The malware will not run unless you have an environment with features that the malware controls. Target-oriented malware usually performs controls such as operating system information, operating system language, location information of the system via IP address, timezone information. You may need to create an environment targeted by malware to ensure that it displays malicious activities.


-- Use Different Network --

We mentioned that attackers develop targeted malware. One of the methods of detecting that malicious software is running on the desired target systems is to use the geolocation information of the IP address.

For example, in order to run a malicious software that is targeting France only, the attackers check whether the device is located in France or not by querying the IP address of the infected device in IP-GeoLocation services. For this reason, when your malware does not work, you can enable the device to access to the Internet through different countries IP addresses with the help of VPN tools.

“Which country should I choose when faced with this kind of situation?”

There is no definitive answer for this question. You have the chance to learn the country information by analyzing the malware with the help of static analysis, but you can reach a faster solution by guessing the attacker's target before using this method.

For example, if a malware is transmitted via an e-mail, you can try the countries where the language of the e-mail is spoken. If the e-mail is written in Spanish, you can try countries such as Spain, Mexico, Colombia, etc.


-- Other Methods --

You will most likely see the malware start to show activity as the methods we mentioned so far are the most used. However, there are still other methods that you can try.

- Try running the malware from a different directory.
- Change the screen resolution.
- Perform activities on the operating system while the malware is running. (Creating different processes, moving the mouse, writing, etc.)
