As mentioned, handling malware is dangerous because it is software explicitly designed to cause harm, steal information, or compromise the security and functionality of computer systems. Given this, we will again introduce the concept of malware sandboxing.

A "Sandbox" is like a pretend computer setup that acts like a real one. It's a safe place for experts to test malware and see how it behaves without any danger. Having a sandbox environment is essential when conducting malware analysis because it stops experts from running malware on their actual work computers, which could be risky and harmful.


-- Static Analysis vs Dynamic Analysis --

Which approach to use when analyzing malware depends on the current circumstances. In cases where you want to get fast results, you can choose dynamic analysis, but we cannot say that the analysis is complete without doing both static and dynamic analysis.

It should also be noted that using only one approach may not be sufficient to analyze malware. Using both approaches together will lead you to victory!

Static Analysis:
· Static analysis takes long time
· You can learn the capacity of the malware
· Detailed analysis result

Dynamic Analysis:
· Dynamic analysis in general takes a short while
· As a result of dynamic analysis, you can learn only the activities on the system on which it is run
· Analysis result is not detailed

As a result, we cannot say that one approach is better than another. Each has an advantage over each other in different conditions.
