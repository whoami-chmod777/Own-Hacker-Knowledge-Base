As mentioned, handling malware is dangerous because it is software explicitly designed to cause harm, steal information, or compromise the security and functionality of computer systems. Given this, we will again introduce the concept of malware sandboxing.

A "Sandbox" is like a pretend computer setup that acts like a real one. It's a safe place for experts to test malware and see how it behaves without any danger. Having a sandbox environment is essential when conducting malware analysis because it stops experts from running malware on their actual work computers, which could be risky and harmful.
