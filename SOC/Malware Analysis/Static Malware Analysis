It is the approach of analyzing malicious software by reverse engineering methods without running them. 

Generally, by decompile / disassemble the malware, each step that the malware will execute is analyzed, hence the behavior / capacity of the malware can be analyzed.

Your device will not be infected as you do not run malicious software in static analysis. (However, we do not recommend performing static analysis on your host device, it will be more proper to do your analysis in a virtual operating system.)

The information examined during the static analysis is as follows.

· P.E. (Portable Executable) Headers
· Imported DLL’s
· Exported DLL’s
· Strings in binary
· CPU Instructions
