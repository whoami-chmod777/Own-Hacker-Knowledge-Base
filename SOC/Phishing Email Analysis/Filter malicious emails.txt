-- Activity Overview --

In this activity, you will analyze a suspicious email and identify signs of a phishing attack. Then, you will determine whether the email should be allowed or quarantined. 

Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous forms of social engineering that you’ll encounter in the field. Identifying phishing attempts will help you prevent threats and find ways to improve security procedures.


-- Scenario --

You’re a security analyst at an investment firm called Imaginary Bank. An executive at the firm recently received a spear phishing email that appears to come from the board of Imaginary Bank. Spear phishing is a malicious email attack targeting a specific user or group of users, appearing to originate from a trusted source. In this case, the executive is being asked to install new collaboration software, ExecuTalk.

The executive suspects this email might be a phishing attempt because ExecuTalk was never mentioned during the last board meeting. They've forwarded the message to your team to verify if it’s legitimate. Your supervisor has tasked you with investigating the message and determining whether it should be quarantined.

-- Step 2: Examine the sender's information --

· There is a misspelling in the subject line
· The sender is using a different domain

Two clues in the message header that indicate that this is a phishing attempt are that there is a misspelling in the subject line and the sender is using a different domain. Phishing emails commonly contain glaring spelling and grammatical errors. Another typical sign of phishing is when messages come from external domains, like a personal Gmail account.


-- Step 3: Review the message body for clues --

· The brand labeling
· The title of the group
· The download options for major operating systems

The brand labeling, the download options for major operating systems, and the title of the group, are all details that make this message appear legitimate.


-- Step 4: Investigate  the download options --

Phishing emails often contain links that redirect to malicious sites or trigger malware downloads.

Pro tip: When investigating suspicious emails, hovering your mouse cursor over buttons will reveal the URL they redirect to without having to click them. This is the safest way to check if it will take you to a suspicious domain or if it links to an http:// URL that isn’t secure.

In this case, the message contains three download options. Each of them opens this login form:


3. The download options open a webpage that contains a login form where someone can enter a username and password. Carefully review the webpage. What is the main clue that indicates this form is malicious?

The URL
The URL is the main clue that indicates this form is malicious. Threat actors make this difficult to spot by design. When accessing SaaS services, like Microsoft applications, the URL typically includes the organization’s domain.
