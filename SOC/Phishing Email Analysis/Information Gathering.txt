-- Spoofing --

Several protocols have been created to prevent the Email Spoofing technique. With the help of SPF, DKIM and DMARC protocols, it can be understood whether the sender's address is fake or real.

· Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
· DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

To find out manually whether the mail is spoof or not, SMTP address of the mail should be learned first. SPF, DKIM, DMARC and MX records of the domain can be learned using tools such as Mxtoolbox.

-- E-mail Traffic Analysis --

We can learn the size of the attack and the target audience in the search results to be made on the mail gateway according to the following parameters.

· Sender Address(info@letsdefend.io)
· SMTP IP Address(127.0.0.1)
· @letsdefend.io (domain base)
· letsdefend (Besides the gmail account, attacker may have sent from the hotmail account)
· Subject (sender address and SMTP address may be constantly changing)

In the search results, it is necessary to learn the recipient addresses and time information besides the mail numbers. If harmful e-mails are constantly forwarded to the same users, their e-mail addresses may have leaked in some way and shared on sites such as PasteBin.

Attackers can find email addresses with theHarvester tool on Kali Linux. It is recommended that such information should not be shared explicitly, as keeping personal mail addresses on websites would be a potential attack vector for attackers.

If mails are sent out of working hours, the attacker may be living on a different time-zone line. By gathering such information, we can begin to make sense of the attack.
