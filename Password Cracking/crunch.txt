Crunch is a tool developed in C by **bofh28** that can create custom, highly modifiable wordlists that may aid an attacker in the situations mentioned above. It takes in min size, max size and alphanumeric character sets as input and generates any possible combination of words with or without meaning and writes it out in a text file.

# Installation and first run
apt install crunch
crunch 1 3 -o dict.txt
